# Nagios/Icinga plugins for monitoring OpenShift 3.x

This package provides Nagios-compatible plugins to verify the operation of
OpenShift clusters.


## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* `oc` binary

The plugins are tested with Icinga 2.5 or newer, but they should also work with
other consumers of Nagios-compatible plugins.


## Getting started

Install the plugins from our [Ubuntu
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~vshn/+archive/ubuntu/icinga), or build the Debian
packages from source.

### Using the plugins on OMD

After installing from PPA, move the plugins from `/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/` to `/opt/omd/sites/<sitename>/local/lib/nagios/plugins`. Make sure the permissions are set to <sitename>. After that, using WATO, go to `Host & Service Parameters -> Active checks -> Classical active and passive Monitoring checks` and create one custom check for every check and every host you want to check, like the example below:
  
  ```
Service description:    Node 'node1.example.com' check
Command line:			      $USER2$/check_openshift_node -f /path/to/kubeconfig -n node1.example.com
  ```

And specify the host you would like to check as a condition of the check.

## List of plugins

Each plugin has a list of parameters available using the argument `-h`.

### `check_hawkular_machine_timestamp`

Check whether the monitoring data in Hawkular has been updated recently.


### `check_openshift_cert_expiry_report`

Check status of all certificates managed and reported on by [OpenShift
Ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/).


### `check_openshift_es_stats`

Collect statistics from Elasticsearch instance (i.e. part of the aggregated
logging system) with optional limits.


### `check_openshift_node`

Check status of a node within a cluster.


### `check_openshift_node_fluentd`

Check whether a [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) pod is running on every
machine.


### `check_openshift_node_list`

Check whether list of nodes in cluster matches passed list. Reports on
unexpected and missing nodes.


### `check_openshift_node_log_heartbeat`

Query Elasticsearch to determine whether node has recently submitted
timestamped log message to logging component.


### `check_openshift_node_resources`

Check whether node resources (CPU, memory) are within given limits.


### `check_openshift_object_stats`

Compute statistics on a number of cluster objects and apply given limits.


### `check_openshift_pod_count`

Check whether number of running pods for a given namespace and selector is
equal to or larger than expected.


### `check_openshift_pod_cpu_usage`

Retrieve and apply limits to CPU usage by pods. Requires the OpenShift metrics
component.


### `check_openshift_pod_memory`

Retrieve and apply limits to memory usage by pods. Requires the OpenShift
metrics component.


### `check_openshift_pod_node_alloc`

Check whether all pods matching given selector are running on disparate nodes.


### `check_openshift_pod_status_count`

Retrieve metrics over whole cluster for each recognized pod status, i.e.
`Running` or `CrashLoopBackOff`.


### `check_openshift_project_phase`

Check whether all projects are in a healthy status, i.e. `active`.


### `check_openshift_pv_avail`

Apply limits to number of available physical volumes for given selector or
capacity.


### `check_openshift_pvc_phase`

Check for unhealthy persistent volume claims.
